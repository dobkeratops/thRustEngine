Nowhere near an 'engine' yet, I just like the name.

This sourcebase is continued from the long since bitrotted 'android_rust_gl' which was pre v1.0.
Various 3d experiments in rust (shaders, voxels, a 3d editor)
supports emscripten/asmjs; 

Haven't tried Android in a while so it probably doesn't work anymore but will eventually go back to it.
In the process of moving helper code out into seperate cargo dependancies.

I tend to dable with rust on and off - some language features impress me immensely whilst others relevant to how pleasant I find it for core 3d programming (maths/datastructures) annoy the hell out of me. I've come back to Rust motivated by 'emscripten' recently.
